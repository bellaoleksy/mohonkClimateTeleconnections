Here, we used a 35-year dataset of weekly, year-round temperature profiles for Mohonk Lake, NY, to evaluate local, regional, and global drivers of trends in lake thermal structure. Our objectives were twofold. First, we explored hypothesized climatic drivers at different seasonal scales and identified the mechanisms responsible for temperature changes in surface and deep waters in a small, dimictic lake (Figure S1). Second, we aimed to explain drivers of interannual variability in lake thermal structure and stratification phenology. We developed a metric to capture all details about the stratified period–including timing of onset of stratification, stratification strength, length of stratification–called mixing action, defined as the total energy required to mix a lake over an entire stratified season. We compared mixing action directly to global metrics of climate change and teleconnections because both simultaneously affect the same local weather variables. We expected mixing action to increase with global atmospheric warming, but that some of the variability from that relationship would relate to teleconnections.
